		<h3>About me</h3>

		<p>
			My name is CoIin Quirk I grew up in Orland Park where I went to Carl Sandburg High School. I was a part of the robotics Club and chess club the most my high school years. When I finish school I moved to Chicago with my dad and started work at Michaels as an associate for the last year-and-a-half. Then I found general assembly and it peaked my interest because I was hoping to learn how to develop a front-end website.I started the program in February and ended in April. Since then I've been looking into other programs and colleges.

				My hobbies have been Warhammer 40k and soccer for most of my life. Warhammer 40,000 is a science fantasy tabletop war game set in approximately the year 40,000 AD. Where you battle armies to control the fate of the Galaxy.I play the Space Marines which are genetically altered super soldiers who live and die for the emperor. I played soccer for at least 10 years of my life.I primarily play defense and forward. I also used to play baseball for three years. I also used to like listening to the radio a lot.
